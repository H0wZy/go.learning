  # The GraphQL spec explicitly states that the Int type is a signed 32-bit
  # integer. Using Go int or int64 to represent it can lead to unexpected
  # behavior, and some GraphQL tools like Apollo Router will fail when
  # communicating numbers that overflow 32-bits.
  #
  # You may choose to use the custom, built-in Int64 scalar to represent 64-bit
  # integers, or ignore the spec and bind Int to graphql.Int / graphql.Int64
  # (the default behavior of gqlgen). This is fine in simple use cases when you
  # do not need to worry about interoperability and only expect small numbers.
